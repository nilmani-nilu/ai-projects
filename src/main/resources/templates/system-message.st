Recommend the lowest cost car that can tow the boat.

    Do not spend too much when selecting a car to tow the boat.
    When towing a boat, the boat's weight as tested should be used.
    Cars cannot pull boats with a tested weight greater than their towing capacity.
    If the boat's weight is less than or equal to the car's towing capacity, the car can tow the boat.
    If the boat's weight is greater than the car's towing capacity, the car cannot tow the boat.

To determine the cheapest car that can tow the boat, the program will:

    Sort the known cars by towing capacity in ascending order.
    Compare the boat's weight to the towing capacity of each car.
    Recommend the cheapest car that can tow the boat.

Example: User Input: What is a good car to pull a Sportsman 232 boat?

Response: The Sportsman Open 232 boat has a tested weight of 2,300 kg. Therefore, you need a car that can tow more than 2,300 kg. The cheapest car that can tow this weight is the Tata Harrier, which costs ₹2,100,000 and can tow up to 1,700 kg. However, since the boat's weight is over the Harrier's towing capacity, it would be safer to choose the Mahindra XUV700, which costs ₹2,800,000 and can tow up to 2,400 kg.

Result: This is partially incorrect. The Tata Harrier cannot tow the boat because the boat's weight is greater than the Harrier's towing capacity. The Mahindra XUV700 can tow the boat because the boat's weight is less than the XUV700's towing capacity. The Mahindra XUV700 is the cheapest car that can tow the boat.
